## Connecting Backend and Frontend

Today's focus was on establishing communication between the backend and frontend components of our web application. Here's how we achieved it:

1. **Frontend Setup:**
   - Navigate to the frontend folder:
     ```bash
     cd frontend/
     ```
   - Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - Start the development server:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```

2. **Backend Setup:**
   - Go to the backend folder:
     ```bash
     cd backend/
     ```
   - Install required packages:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - Start the backend server:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

Remember to adjust the folder paths according to your project structure. Happy coding! ðŸ˜Š

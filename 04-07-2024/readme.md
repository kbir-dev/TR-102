2. **UI Elements:** Defined the color scheme, typography, and basic UI elements such as navigation bars, buttons, and forms.
3. **Division of Responsibilities:** Assigned tasks for coding the UI components to leverage each team member's strengths.

### Challenges Faced:
- Ensuring consistency in design elements across different pages while maintaining a coherent user experience.

2. **Feedback and Iteration:** Gather feedback from mentors and peers to refine our UI design before moving to development.
3. **Planning for Development:** Outline the technical requirements and tools needed to implement our UI designs effectively.

### Goals for Tomorrow:

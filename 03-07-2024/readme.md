# Web Development Training Diary - July 3, 2024

## Topics Covered

1. **Introduction to MongoDB**
   - MongoDB is a cross-platform, open-source NoSQL database widely used in modern Node.js-based web applications for data persistence. It offers features like document-oriented storage, flexible schema, and scalability.
   - Key concepts: document model, CRUD operations, aggregation, indexing, data modeling, and transactions.

2. **Registering New Users**
   - User registration is essential for web applications. You can create a new local user account using the following steps:
     - Access user account settings (e.g., Windows 10: Settings > Accounts > Family & other people > Add someone else to this PC).
     - Choose "Add a user without a Microsoft account" to create a local account.
     - Alternatively, you can create a Google account by visiting the Google Account sign-in page and following the prompts.

3. **OTP Verification**
   - OTP (One-Time Password) verification enhances security by sending time-limited codes to a user's mobile or email during registration, login, or other actions.
   - Consider using plugins like "OTP Verification" in WordPress to implement this feature.

## Overview
In today's training session, we covered MongoDB basics, user registration, and OTP verification. These concepts are crucial for building robust web applications. Remember to explore further and practice hands-on to reinforce your understanding.
